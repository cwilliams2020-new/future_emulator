Scripts needed to run emulator for 1 Myr into the future

Please note that these are only the scripts, not the data files themselves (which are too large/numerous to upload here) i.e. not the 90*4 input 5 forcing text files, not the 90*4 input glacial state files, not the >120 GCM netcdf, and not all of the GCM orography/mask files needed for downscaling.  Email CW if these are needed.
